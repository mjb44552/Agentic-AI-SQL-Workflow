# Agentic Ski Resort Recommendation System

## Project Aim:

This project aims to create an Agentic AI workflow which allows users to ask natural language questions 
and receive answers to queries requiring data from a Postgres database.

Currently this project is set up to retrieve the characteristics of ski resorts from around the world. 

## Project Description: 

This project utalises AI agents developed using open-source Agno Agents (https://docs.agno.com/reference/agents/agent). 

In it's current form the project has an agent workflow with two agents:
1. sql_input_agent: This agent generates SQL queries which will extract useful data for answering user questions. 
2. sql_output_agent: This agents runs sql_input_agent's SQL query. It returns, summarises and explains it's results in a easily readable format.

The project was also designed to extract data using AI, but not pass all the data directly to the AI. The concepts from this project
could be used to design, build and deploy AI applications which cannot simply add data to an AI query because:
1. Volume of data constraints:  Feeding all available data into an AI system will exceed context windows and token limits. 
2. Sensitive data constraints: The data to be extracted is private and confidential and shouldn't be used to train publically available models.

## Project Scope:

This project's agentic workflow is a minimum viable product showing how AI can automate building SQL queries to extract data from a database. This project shows the benefits of using an AI's semantic understanding of a database's schema to build SQL queries so that data extraction 
can be more intuitive and flexible. 

For development convenience this project uses Open AI's models to build it's queries. However this projects workflow can be adapted 
to use isolated and enterprise specific models which don't use user queries to train publically available models. 

## Setting up Python Environment:

### .env file:
Use the example_env.txt file to setup your own .env file. The only change needed is to add your private Open AI API key.
Don't change the variable names or variable values for any of the other envrionment variables defined in the example_env.txt file.  

### Python Package Requirements: 
Use the requirements.txt file to download all the required python packages for this project. Use the following command:

<pre> ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` </pre>

## Setting up Docker and Databases for Agno Agents:

The AI agents in this project (sql_input_agent and sql_output_agent) each use databases to complete their tasks.
The sql_input_agent uses a Postgres Vector database as a knowledge base. The knowledbe base contains the metadata and schema information for
sql_output_agent's database. This helps the sql_input_agent to build syntactically correct and error free SQL queries which the sql_output agent runs. The sql_output_agent runs the SQL query generated by sql_input_agent on traditional Postgres database to gather data which answers
the users initial question. 

These databases are hosted inside a docker container. To build the container and initialise the databases run the following command. 

<pre> ```docker-compose up -d ``` </pre>

To allow the python application to access the databases add to your .env file the credentials of each database. __Use the exact variable
names in the example_env.txt file__.

When you are finished using the application you can close down the databases and their docker container using the following command.

<pre> ```docker-compose down ``` </pre>

## Data: 

The data for this project was sourced from: 
1. OpenSkiMap.org: https://openskimap.org/?about#6.11/38.697/-109.641
2. Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hserdaraltan/countries-by-continent

Open Ski Map Organisation allows their data to be downloaded daily in a csv form. Currently, the project uses a local
version of this data to build its database and answer user questions.

Kaggle provides open-source datasets to account holders (free to join). This data was used to map countries to their 
relative continents. Open Ski Map's data didn't include continent data.
